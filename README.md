# SNX Partners Payout Tool

## Getting Started

Update `/config.js`.

Add an `NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` environmental variable. For local development, add to `.env.local`. (This is optional, but will make the Payout Status widget more accurate and reliable.)

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
